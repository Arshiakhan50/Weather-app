# Live Weather Forecast App

The Live Weather Forecast Web App is a Python-based project built with Flask, a lightweight web framework, and leverages the WeatherAPI.com API to provide real-time weather information for locations around the world. This web application allows users to enter a location, and it fetches and displays current weather data including temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, humidity, and more.

This Python project utilizes the Flask web framework to create a web application that communicates with the WeatherAPI.com API to deliver live weather data. When a user enters a location and clicks the "What's the Weather" button, the application sends a request to the API, passing the user's input as a query parameter. The API responds with detailed weather information for the specified location, including temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and more.
